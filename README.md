# Fake News Detection by Learning Convolution Filters through Contextualized Attention

#Dataset
The LIAR dataset consists of 12,836 short statements taken from POLITIFACT and labeled by humans for truthfulness, subject, context/venue, speaker, state, party, and prior history. For truthfulness, the LIAR dataset has six labels: pants-fire, false, mostly-false, half-true, mostly-true, and true. These six label sets are relatively balanced in size. The statements were collected from a variety of broadcasting mediums, like TV interviews, speeches, tweets, debates, and they cover a broad range of topics such as the economy, health care, taxes and election. The LIAR-PLUS dataset is an extension to the LIAR dataset by automatically extracting for each claim the justification that humans have provided in the fact-checking article associated with the claim.
